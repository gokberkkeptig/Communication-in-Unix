I have provided some files in order to show input and output formats. These files(additional.txt and output.txt) are created by the program called test. I provided input.txt files. Both programs needs the n input in the beginning of the program. This indicates how many children will be created. You can more files as long as their name "input%d.txt" means %d any number. 

-assingment1.c -> test
This program creates and reads intermediate files called "additional%d.txt". 
-assingment1usingPipes.c -> testPipe

This program uses pipes instead of creating and reading intermediate files.
